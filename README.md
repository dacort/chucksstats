Stats for [Chuck's on 85th](http://chucks85th.com/)

Overview
========
If you don't know [Chuck's on 85th](http://chucks85th.com/), it's a former corner store
that has evolved with the times and come to be a gathering place for North Ballard beer lovers.
With 38 taps, over 1,000 bottled beers, and rotating food trucks every day, it's a great place to share a pint.

One of the great benefits is that Chuck's keeps it's on-tap list up-to-date on their website. Being a stats nerd,
I thought it would be a fun to put something together to gather the beers on a regular basis and answer some 
questions:
* How long does a beer stay on tap?
* What are the most properly breweries?
* What are the most popular types of beer?
* What's new today?
And a whole host of other questions.

ToDo
====
I still have a number of plans for the app.
* ~~Prettier charts~~
* Top breweries in the past week
* Stats per brewery
* Top beers per brewery
* Support for multiple locations (specifically [Chuck's CD](http://www.chuckscd.com/))
